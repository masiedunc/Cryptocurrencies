# Cryptocurrencies

## Purpose
Working with Accountability Accounting, the purpose of this project is to create a report that analyzes and classifies cryptocurrencies on the trading market to gain a better understanding of cryptocurrencies and a classification system for this new investment. This project utilized unsupervised machine learning since there is no known output, to classify and group cryptocurrencies into a clustering algorithm. The visualizations created will be shared with the board so they may make an informed decision regarding the future of cryptocurrencies and Accountability Accounting.

## Summary 
This 3-D scatter plot was obtained using the PCA algorithm to reduce the crytocurrencies dimensions to three principal components.

*3D-Scatter plot with clusters*

Plotting the scatter plot from two cryptocurrency features directly does not efficiently segregate the different classes. Then using the PCA algorithm is the right method for better visualizations.

*2D-Scatter plot with TotalCoinMined vs TotalCoinSupply*

We have identified the classification of 532 cryptocurrencies based on similarities of their features.
Particularities of each group need to be analyzed to determined their performance and potential interest for the investment bank's clients.
