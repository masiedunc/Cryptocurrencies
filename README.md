# Cryptocurrencies

## Purpose
Working with Accountability Accounting, the purpose of this project is to create a report that analyzes and classifies cryptocurrencies on the trading market to gain a better understanding of cryptocurrencies and a classification system for this new investment. This project utilized unsupervised machine learning since there is no known output, to classify and group cryptocurrencies into a clustering algorithm. The visualizations created will be shared with the board so they may make an informed decision regarding the future of cryptocurrencies and Accountability Accounting.

## Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results
### 3D Scatter Plot
Using PCA algorithm, this 3-D scatter plot shows the clusters classes that were predicted for the cryptocurrencies

### 2D Scatter Plot
We then used a 2D scatter plot to visualize two cryptocurrency features, TotalCoinMined and TotalCoinSupply. It seems there is no obvious classification between the two features, yet you can identify possible outliers. When presenting to the board, the PCS algorithm and visualizations may be more appropriate.
